# CodeClause_URL_Shortner
- This is a Python script that creates a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for a URL shortener tool using the tkinter module. The GUI has a heading, a label asking for the user's input, an entry field for the user to enter the URL, an image-based button to execute the URL shortening functionality, and a label to display the resulting shortened URL.

- The script uses the PIL (Python Imaging Library) and pyshorteners modules. PIL is used to load and display the image button. pyshorteners allows you to shorten and expand URLs.
